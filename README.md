# Wikipedia-API
In this notebook, I generate a data set of people who have Wikipedia articles written about them. The goal of the assignment given was to determine the year that had the most "famous" people born in it.

# The Work
To accomplish this goal, I iterated through the 150 years prior to and including 2015. Using Wikipedia's API, I pulled a list of famous people born in each year. I then wrote the results to a text file and determined the year that (at the time) had the most births.
